        <h1>Iris Féanorá</h1>
        <p>
            Yes, hi, that's me: Iris Félicia Autumn Féanorá. Yes, I need to make a better website - or anything resembling a proper website at all, for that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been actively programming in C# since 2017, C++ since early 2011. Other languages I actually use include and are limited to Java.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm actively making Minecraft mods for 1.15.1, writing a Discord bot and the associated toolchain, and making a custom Minecraft Launcher - there's a bit more on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> site.
        </p>
