        Hi, I'm your local trans-girl - specifically aro-ace trans-fae (she/her please thanks, dont really mind they/them). I greatly enjoy fire, swords and programming. <br>
        I love elves, from elven languages such as Quenya over clothing and art to their art of smithery. <br>
        I also go by copious amounts of names; an incomplete and not guaranteed to be up-to-date list is here: <br>
        Iris, Félicia, Autumn, Athina, Lou, Ailina/Ailinel, Tinúviel, Ailinaéndorenáel, Almiel, Elenwé (or Élenwé), Féaniel, Fíriel, Ilmaré, Ilthániel, Vinya, Mairén, Anairé, ... <br>
        Feel free to ask me about any of them. Occasionally I even take name suggestions :>
