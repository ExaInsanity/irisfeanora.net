        <h1>Minecraft 1.15.1</h1>
        <p>
            Minecraft 1.15.1 is a mostly abandoned version - which is quite understandable, considering it is not the final release of the 1.15 cycle and only few people actually
            use the 1.15 release cycle to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, 1.15.1 is also a great version especially for technical gameplay, therefore some of us have decided to just... maintain it.
